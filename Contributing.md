### Test and file issues

It would be really useful to have people use rustfmt on their projects and file
issues where it does something you don't expect.

A really useful thing to do that on a crate from the Rust repo. If it does
something unexpected, file an issue; if not, make a PR to the Rust repo with the reformatted code. I hope to get the whole repo consistently rustfmt'ed and to
replace `make tidy` with rustfmt as a medium-term goal.

### Create test cases

Having a strong test suite for a tool like this is essential. It is very easy
to create regressions. Any tests you can add are very much appreciated.

### Hack!

Here are some [good starting issues](https://github.com/nrc/rustfmt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aeasy).
Note than some of those issues tagged 'easy' are not that easy and might be better
second issues, rather than good first issues to fix.

If you've found areas which need polish and don't have issues, please submit a
PR, don't feel there needs to be an issue.
